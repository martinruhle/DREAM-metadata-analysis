# DREAM Metadata Analysis of Preterm Birth

## Overview
This repository contains an analysis of the DREAM challenge metadata related to preterm birth. Our objective is to explore the relationships between demographic, clinical, and microbiome data to understand their impact on preterm birth outcomes. We provide a series of scripts for exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into three main directories:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files used in the analysis.
- `scripts/`: Contains R, Python, and Jupyter notebook scripts for data analysis and visualization.
- `results/`: Stores the output files generated by the scripts.

## Data Files
- **metadata_normalized.csv**: A normalized metadata file focusing on NIH racial categories without preterm data.
- **NIHRacialDelivery_WeekStatistics.csv**: Contains statistics of delivery weeks segmented by NIH racial categories.
- **taxonomy_relabd.species.csv**: A normalized table of bacterial species relative abundances for each sample.
- **EdadesNIHRacialCategory.csv**: A table with age distributions by NIH racial category.
- **metadata.csv**: The main DREAM metadata file including 1895 samples with demographic, delivery, and microbiome details.

## Main Analysis Scripts
### 1. **EDA_Preterm_Birth.Rmd**
   - **Objective**: Performs an exploratory analysis of preterm birth metadata to examine participant demographics, pregnancy outcomes, and delivery weeks.
   - **Libraries**: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `polycor`
   - **Output**: `EDA_Preterm_Birth.html`

### 2. **Heatmap_rel_abun.Rmd**
   - **Objective**: Generates a heatmap of relative bacterial abundances, grouped by NIH racial categories and term status.
   - **Libraries**: `pheatmap`, `dplyr`, `RColorBrewer`
   - **Output**: `Heatmap_rel_abun.html`

### 3. **prediction_model_NIH_cat.Rmd**
   - **Objective**: Implements a logistic regression model using NIH racial category as a predictor for preterm birth.
   - **Libraries**: `tidymodels`
   - **Output**: `prediction_model_NIH_cat.html`

## Additional Scripts
These scripts provide supplementary analyses and visualizations, yet lack comprehensive documentation and comments:

- **exploratory_analysis.R**: General exploratory data analysis.
- **heatmap.R**: Creates a heatmap of microbial abundances.
- **HeatMapBactericommunXNIHRacial.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for bacterial community heatmap analysis.
- **MACHINELEARNING(NIHRACIAL).ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for machine learning model building.
- **networks.R**: Analyzes co-occurrence networks in the dataset.
- **PCA.R**: Performs principal component analysis.
- **Tidymodels_prediction_NIHRacial.R**: An alternative prediction model using tidymodels.
- **bactery10mostcommunXNIHRacialCategory.ipynb**: Analyzes the ten most common bacterial communities by NIH racial category.
- **Birth_per_week_racial_cat.py**: Summarizes births per week by racial category.
- **dendogram_circular.R**: Generates a circular dendrogram for hierarchical clustering.
- **EDA_Preterm_Birth.Rmd**: Comprehensive EDA of preterm birth data.

## Results
- **EDA_Preterm_Birth.html**: HTML report for preterm birth exploratory analysis.
- **Heatmap_rel_abun.html**: Heatmap report showing bacterial relative abundances by racial category and term status.
- **NumeroNacimintosSemanaPartoNIhRacial.png**: Graph of births per delivery week segmented by NIH racial categories.
- **prediction_model_NIH_cat.html**: HTML output of the logistic regression model analysis.
- **dendogram_circular.pdf**: Circular dendrogram visualization of hierarchical clustering.

## Requirements
The following R packages are required to run the analyses:
- `ggplot2`
- `dplyr`
- `polycor`
- `knitr`
- `pheatmap`
- `RColorBrewer`
- `tidymodels`

## Usage Instructions
To replicate the analyses in this repository:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Place all required data files in the `data/` directory.
3. Open any RMarkdown, R script, Python script, or Jupyter notebook in the `scripts/` directory to begin the analyses.
4. Follow any chunk-specific instructions within each RMarkdown or notebook file for individual analyses.

## Analysis Summary
The analysis provides insights into preterm birth, including:

1. **Demographic Trends**: Examination of participant age, race, and their association with preterm birth.
2. **Bacterial Profiles**: Characterization of bacterial communities associated with term and preterm births, visualized through heatmaps.
3. **Predictive Models**: Logistic regression models developed to predict preterm birth using NIH racial categories.
